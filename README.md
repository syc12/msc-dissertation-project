# msc-dissertation-project
This was submitted on the 21st August 2020 as part of my dissertation project for the Master's in Computer Science degree at Newcastle University. 
In this project, I investigated the existing and new methods of predicting stock price. 
In particular, the ARIMA model is a robust and established model. 
On the other hand, the Prophet model, a newer additive model claims to be better than the ARIMA. 
Finally, the LSTM model, a type of neural network model, is also used due to its ability to learn sequences of input and its ability to filter input by forgetting information it considers irrelevant.
